				<h2 id="intro" class="no-display">Introduction</h2>
				<p>Many existing websites have accessibility barriers that make using them difficult or impossible for people with disabilities. The barriers may be as a result of little or no consideration for accessibility when the website was created or may have slowly developed as new content was added. Addressing accessibility may be tackled as a standalone project or part of broader site maintenance activities. In either case there are considerations that help make the process more efficient and effective.</p>

				<h3>What is this document for?</h3>
					<p>This document provides you with information on what is important to consider when seeking to improve the accessibility of a website. The related document on <a href="Overview">Implementation Planning</a> may be useful if you are considering accessibility from a more strategic perspective. Many of the topics discussed are relevant to improving accessibility for existing websites.</p>
				<h3>Who is it for?</h3>
					<p>This document is for project managers, project team leaders, website owners and managers, web developers, and small business owners. It is likely that you will be relatively new to accessibility or new to managing accessibility projects.</p>
					<p>If you are new to accessibility these related resources may help your general understanding of the topic:</p>
					<ul>
				    <li><a href="/standards/webdesign/accessibility">W3C - Accessibility</a> – The place to start for a short introduction to Web accessibility.</li>
				    <li><a href="/WAI/intro/components.php">Essential Components of Web Accessibility</a> - Shows how web accessibility depends on several components of web development and interaction working together and the relationship between the WAI guidelines.</li>
				    <li><a href="/WAI/intro/people-use-web/">How People with Disabilities Use the Web</a> -  Examples of people with different disabilities using websites, applications, browsers, and authoring tools.</li>
						<li><a href="/WAI/bcase/Overview">Developing a Web Accessibility Business Case</a> - Presents benefits and costs of Web accessibility and includes guidance on incorporating these aspects into a specific organization's business case.						</li>
					</ul>
				<h3>Using this document</h3>
					<p>This document presents the information as topics that you will need to consider. Information from prior topics is often required for subsequent activities so you may need to consider how you plan to approach them.</p>

				<h2 id="scope">Determine Scope and Target</h2>
				<p>The motivations and pressures for your improvement project will likely influence your scope and target. For example, if customer feedback on your website suggests an accessibility barrier that prevents use, then you probably want to fix that first. Similarly, if you are legally required to meet a certain level of accessibility, then your target will be at least that level.</p>
				<p>Your scope may be confined to a specific barrier, for example poor <mark title="not contrast ratio?">color contrast</mark> in your main content. Even with this restricted scope you might take the opportunity to address other identified issues in related areas of the website. For example, while addressing <mark>color contrast</mark> in the <mark title="seems oddly specific"><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> you might also fix keyboard focus styling of links in the same <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> [[I don’t expect small business owners to understand this. Do they need to?]]</mark>.</p>
				<p>By specifying what websites or pages are to be assessed and to what standard you will be able to limit the scope to something that is achievable. If you have limited resources then there is the opportunity to define a multi-tiered target with different dates for different areas of the website or conformance levels.</p>

				<h3>Key actions</h3>
				<ul class="key-actions">
					<li><span class="f_panelHead">Set a standard and conformance level.</span>
						<div>
							<p>Most organizations use <mark title="very sudden"><a href="/TR/WCAG20/"><abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr></a> [[I think having WCAG introduced by name and also mention that it is a W3C standard could be useful.]]</mark> as a target for accessibility and specify what level of success criteria they aim to meet. Your organization may already have an accessibility policy that specifies what standard and level you need to achieve.</p>
						</div>
					</li>
					<li><span class="f_panelHead">Define what is to be evaluated.</span>
						<div>
							<p>Your project may be a single website or a part of a larger site. You will need to carefully consider your timescales and available resources when determining the scope. Where you <mark title="in practice, that is always ;)">initially have limited resources</mark> focusing on key user journeys and pages may bring the most significant benefits.</p>
						</div>

				</ul>

				<p class="totop"><a href="#contents">back to page contents</a></p>


			  <h2 id="assess">Assess the Situation</h2>
				<p>The goal of assessing your website or <ins>individual</ins> pages is to identify the accessibility barriers and gather information in order to plan for their <mark title="improvement?">repair [[I have the feeling that this can be read ass “only fix what is broken”, instead of “what doesn’t work well”.]]</mark>. Evaluation can focus on specific points to help guide your planning, such as determining if a particular issue is widespread or isolated, or what the impact is on users with disabilities. Your target will define what you need to evaluate against, although it is sometimes beneficial to evaluate to a higher standard. There are likely some higher level criteria that you will be able to easily achieve.</p>
				<p>Rather than thoroughly evaluating every target page, you can focus on representative areas in order to obtain more valuable information with less effort. For example, templates, style sheets, and any shared components, such as navigation bars and footers, only need to be evaluated once.</p>
				<p>Knowing where identified issues originate can help in your planning. For example, if only a few data tables are missing necessary markup, then you might include adding table markup to quality assurance processes. However, if none of the tables are properly marked up, you would consider additional training on data table markup. If tables from one development team are done properly, but another teams are not, this helps further clarify where education is needed.</p>
				<p>Many organizations hire accessibility specialists to evaluate their website. They will also be able to provide guidance on how to respond to the identified barriers. This can include general recommendations on approach and priorities, specific recommendations on solutions, and guidance on the knowledge and skills needed for the repairs.</p>

				<h3>Key actions</h3>
				<ul class="key-actions">
					<li><span class="f_panelHead">Fix any known barriers.</span>
						<div>
							<p>In some cases you may already be aware of accessibility barriers based on user feedback. If easily fixed it may be best to repair these before going further. As well as brining early improvement to the website, if you are involving users in your evaluation known existing barriers may make it difficult to obtain feedback on other areas.</p>
						</div>
					</li>
					<li><span class="f_panelHead">Evaluate using a standardized approach.</span>
						<div>
							<p>Ensure that you are as consistent as possible in applying your evaluation methodology. This allows you to repeat the evaluation and compare the results. <abbr title="Website Accessibility Conformance Evaluation Methodology">WCAG-EM</abbr> is a comprehensive and structured approach to help determine how well a website conforms to <abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr>.</p>
						</div>
					</li>
					<li><span class="f_panelHead">Evaluate with real users.</span>
						<div>
							<p>In addition to helping identify and prioritize accessibility barriers, <mark>watching people struggle to use your site can be a powerful motivator</mark> for your improvement project team.</p>
						</div>
					</li>
					<li><span class="f_panelHead">Use appropriate evaluation and repair tools.</span>
						<div>
							<p>Web accessibility evaluation tools are programs and online services that help check if a website meets accessibility guidelines. There are also tools that help repair accessibility barriers. Some evaluation tools can be configured to be more useful to your specific project. For example, once you figure out your scope, you can configure the tool to only evaluate those criteria and pages. This can speed up the evaluation and simplify the report.</p>
						</div>
					</li>
					<li><span class="f_panelHead">Consider how authoring tools might introduce barriers.</span>
						<div>
							<p>Authoring tools are software or services used to create or modify websites, such as web page editors and content management systems (CMS). Some authoring tools provide better accessibility support than others. You might be able to improve accessibility support in your authoring tool by:</p>
							<ul>
						    <li>Configuring your tools, for example, sometimes accessibility features in authoring tools are disabled by default and need to be turned on.</li>
						    <li>Using plug-ins or other add-on software to extend the accessibility support of your tools.</li>
						    <li>Upgrading your existing tools to the latest version, if they have better accessibility support.</li>
						    <li><mark title="selecting?">Purchasing</mark> different tools with better accessibility support.</li>

							</ul>
							<p>For some content, such as video or <abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr>, there may be an involved creation process with a number of tools involved. Consider each step of the process to identify where issues are introduced and where they may be best addressed.</p>
						</div>
					</li>

			  <h2 id="prioritize">Prioritize Solutions</h2>
				<p>Prioritizing repairs will make implementation more manageable and aims to bring benefit to users as soon as possible. You may also find that resource limitations mean that not all repairs can be made immediately. When considering prioritization, there are two important factors to determine:</p>
				<ol>
					<li><h4>What is the impact on people with disabilities?</h4>
						<p>Accessibility barriers are often identified by WCAG success criteria. Each criteria has a Level (A, AA, AAA) that helps determine the impact of a particular accessibility barrier. The actual impact depends on the context of the barrier and target audience. For example, poor contrast in the main content has a high impact, whereas in generic footers it may have low impact.</p>
						<p>Evaluating with users will also help determine the impact of <ins>any</ins> accessibility <del>any</del> barriers.</p>
					</li>
					<li><h4>What is the effort required for repair?</h4>
						<p>The time, cost, and skills to <mark title="isn’t that the opposite of what we want?">repair a barrier</mark> will vary greatly. For example, repairing an issue in the footer could require a simple change to a template that is automatically propagated throughout the website, or it could require changing every page manually.</p>
						<p>Running workshops with representatives from all teams can help you quickly determine possible solutions and what effort would be required to implement them. Ensure that whoever is responsible for implementing the solutions is part of any discussion as they will know best what constraints exist.</p>
					</li>
				</ol>

				<h3>Key actions</h3>
				<ul class="key-actions">
					<li><span class="f_panelHead">Prioritize by barrier.</span>
						<div>
							<p>You will generally want to prioritize high impact easy fixes first. This will provide the most improvement in the shortest time. Creating a graph of impact versus effort can help you quickly determine the overall priority of barriers. This approach usually takes less time overall, and you get lots of improvement quickly. However, it may result in harder to fix issues always falling out of scope.</p>
						</div>
					</li>
					<li><span class="f_panelHead">Prioritize by area.</span>
						<div>
							<p>It is usually best to first repair those areas that have the greatest impact on user experience. Identify key pages or journeys within the website. For example, the home page may be a primary entry point, or purchasing a product and payment process may be important functions. Frequently-used, high-traffic, pages and functionality can be identified using analytics.</p>
						</div>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Related resources</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="/WAI/intro/people-use-web/Overview">How People with Disabilities Use the Web</a> - Provides examples of how people with disabilities use the web, which can be helpful when prioritizing issues.</li>
				</ul>

				<p class="totop"><a href="#contents">back to page contents</a></p>


			  <h2 id="repair">Implement Repairs</h2>
				<p>Implementing repairs is where the majority of project time will go. Once you have prioritized the issues you will be able to plan how long it will take to fix them based on the identified effort. This should give you a clear indication of what is achievable given the project resources available.</p>
				<p>The brunt of repairs often fall to developers to address but some issues, such as content or issues with process, will be better handled by others. For example, where link text in primary content is unclear, whoever creates your content can address this. For each issue to be address ensure that it is clear who is to undertake the work and that they have the appropriate skills or knowledge. This may identify areas where additional training may be beneficial.</p>

				<h3>Key actions</h3>
				<ul class="key-actions">
					<li><span class="f_panelHead">Review solutions following implementation.</span>
						<div>
							<p>Sometimes there are no perfect solutions or there is uncertainty as to whether a solution might introduce other problems. Running an evaluation of the repairs is vital to ensure that the issue has been sufficiently addressed. This can lead to an ongoing cycle of test and repair which you will need to manage appropriately.</p>
						</div>
					</li>
					<li><span class="f_panelHead">Keep track of solutions.</span>
						<div>
							<p>Where possible it is useful to document what solutions were considered and finally implemented. This helps subsequent projects avoid introducing the same issues, or attempting solutions already shown to be less than ideal. For less experienced and new team members this can be a helpful resource in understanding more about accessibility in your organization.</p>
						</div>
					</li>
					<li><span class="f_panelHead">Consider production processes and training.</span>
						<div>
							<p>Sometimes it is apparent that issues are occurring because of lack or training or problems in the content production process. After the immediate problems are fixed consideration needs to be given to ensuring they don't reoccur. This can take the form of training key staff or changing processes to introduce appropriate quality assurance checks.</p>
						</div>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p class="totop"><a href="#contents">back to page contents</a></p>


			  <h2 id="revisit">Review and Plan to Revisit</h2>
				<p>Once repairs are completed, it is helpful to review what has been achieved and what is still left to do. Knowing what problems still exist will help planning ongoing maintenance. It may also be necessary to communicate known issues to your site visitors especially where you are able to provide suitable alternative approaches.</p>
				<p>Continue to evaluate accessibility in updated pages to ensure that new barriers are not introduced. This may require new or improved quality assurance stages in your web content production process. See the <a href="/WAI/eval/considerations#ongoing">Ongoing monitoring</a> section of the Evaluation Approaches for Specific Contexts document.</p>


				<h3>Key actions</h3>
				<ul class="key-actions">
					<li><span class="f_panelHead">Document any remaining issues.</span>
						<div>
							<p>Knowing what was fixed, how, and what outstanding issues remain can help subsequent maintenance or redesign activities. This will also help maintain momentum for accessibility and reduce subsequent evaluation costs.</p>
						</div>
					</li>
					<li><span class="f_panelHead">Update or create your accessibility conformance statement.</span>
						<div>
							<p>Your accessibility statement can be used to provide contact details for feedback, outline your commitment to accessibility, and provide information to help users optimize their experience. You might also want to summarize how your site is supportive of accessibility, and where you still have work to do. Following completion of any accessibility repairs it is important to review your accessibility statement and update it with any improvements made and known issues.</p>
						</div>
					</li>
					<li><span class="f_panelHead">Consider setting a follow up date.</span>
						<div>
							<p>It is important that the accessibility of your website is regularly reviewed. If possible, at the end of your project set a date for when the accessibility of the website should be next reviewed. This may be part of a regular maintenance schedule or as part of an upcoming improvement or redesign project.</p>
						</div>
					</li>

			  <h2 id="strategic">Next steps: Strategic Planning</h2>
				<p>Thinking about accessibility tactically will generally be less cost effective and efficient that considering it as an integral part of your web development strategies. There are several things you can do to help your organization create more accessible websites as standard.</p>

				<ul>
			    <li><a href="/WAI/impl/Overview">Implementing Web Accessibility Across Organizations and Projects</a> outlines how to integrate accessibility throughout your web development. Ensure that when redesigns or updates are planned, accessibility in included from the start of the project. Accessibility is much less costly and time-consuming when implemented from the beginning of a project, rather than the end.</li>
			    <li>Ensure that you have an effective accessibility policy in place that specifies that your website meet or exceed legal requirements.</li>
